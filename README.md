# CH32 Projects

A collection of example projects and experiments for CH32-series microcontrollers from WCH (Nanjing Qinheng
Microelectronics). This repository serves as a personal playground for embedded development with CH32 devices, focusing
on low-cost, open-source hardware hacking.

## Featured Projects

### picopad-ch32prog

- **Description**: RISC-V microcontroller programmer for WCH CH32V, CH32V00X, and CH32V03X series, running on the
  Picopad handheld device. It enables programming CH32 microcontrollers directly from the Picopad's SD card without
  requiring a PC connection.

### Tinyboy Consol

- **Description**: An adaptation of the CH32V003-GameConsole project by Stefan Wagner for CH32LibSDK, using the
  newer CH32V002J4M6 MCU instead of the discontinued CH32V003.
