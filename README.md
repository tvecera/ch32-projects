# CH32 Projects

A collection of example projects and experiments for CH32-series microcontrollers from WCH (Nanjing Qinheng
Microelectronics). This repository serves as a personal playground for embedded development with CH32 devices, focusing
on low-cost, open-source hardware hacking.

## Featured Projects

### picopad-ch32prog

- **Description**: RISC-V microcontroller programmer for WCH CH32V, CH32V00X, and CH32V03X series, running on the
  Picopad handheld device. It enables programming CH32 microcontrollers directly from the Picopad's SD card without
  requiring a PC connection.

### Tinyboy Console

- **Description**: An adaptation of the CH32V003-GameConsole project by Stefan Wagner for CH32LibSDK, using the
  newer CH32V002J4M6 MCU instead of the discontinued CH32V003.

### Olimex RVPC Port to CH32LibSDK

- **Description**: Port of the RVPC (the EURO 1.00 RISC-V personal computer with VGA, keyboard, and Woz-like monitor)
  from Olimex to the CH32LibSDK.

### ch32-lamp – Music Player (BeatleBeat)

- **Description**: Music module for playing mono WAV (IMA ADPCM) files from an SD card. Based on the BeatleBeat design
  from CH32LibSDK, using the CH32V002x4 MCU. Features BTL PWM output for louder sound without external amplifier.
