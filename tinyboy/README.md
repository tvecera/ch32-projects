# Tinyboy

**Tinyboy console** is based on the [CH32V003-GameConsole](https://github.com/wagiminator/CH32V003-GameConsole) project
by Stefan Wagner.  
Instead of the now discontinued CH32V003, it uses the newer **CH32V002J4M6** MCU.  
I used version 1.1 of the PCB design, which does not include the transistor for the buzzer.

## Schematic

The Tinyboy console does **not include the 6th button (KEY_B)**. Fortunately, most games in **CH32LibSDK** do not
require this button.

## Programming

Programming the console is straightforward using the **WCH-LinkE programmer**.  
Simply connect:

- **SWDIO** from programmer → **DIO**
- **3V3**
- **GND**

The standard tool is **WCH-LinkUtility**, but it is **only available for Windows**.  
For Linux and macOS, alternatives are needed:

### [rvprog](https://github.com/wagiminator/MCU-Flash-Tools?tab=readme-ov-file#rvprog)

- Easy installation (`pip install rvprog`)
- Limitation: fails to upload larger programs (>10 KB) completely into MCU flash

### [minichlink](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32fun/tree/master/minichlink)

- The **most reliable tool** in my experience
- Can reset the MCU even without the reset pin connected
- Automatically detects the WCH-LinkE programmer
- Supports alternative programmers (e.g., via **esp32s2chfun**)
- Drawback: must be compiled manually
    - On macOS I had to remove support for `b003boot` and `esp32s2chfun` to build successfully

Prebuilt binaries for **macOS** and **Linux** are available in the `../tools` folder.

## Battery Measurement

A nice advantage of the Tinyboy console is that it has **no voltage regulator** – the MCU is powered directly from the
battery. This allows you to **measure the battery voltage** using the internal **1.2 V reference** of the CH32V002.

### Example Usage

```c
// The value bat will return the battery voltage in millivolts (mV).

BatInit();
const u32 bat = GetBat();
BatTerm();
```

**Notes**

- The function uses ADC1 in single conversion mode.
- The computation scales the internal 1.2 V reference to the actual supply voltage.
- If you use the KEY service, it must be temporarily disabled while reading the ADC.
- Returns the voltage in millivolts (mV).

## Expansion Possibilities

Because the MCU is in an **SOP-8 package**, the number of available pins is very limited.  
Still, some expansions are possible:

- The **OLED pins** can also be used to connect an **I2C sensor**.  
  With software I2C, you can easily turn the console into a **simple sensor device**.

- Another option is to reuse the **SWIO programming pin**.  
  The SDK provides functions to remap it:

```c
// PD1 as standard GPIO
GPIO_Remap_SWD(4);

// Restore PD1 as SWIO (programming)
GPIO_Remap_SWD(0);
```

⚠️ **Warning:** After remapping PD1 to GPIO, programming will no longer work.  
The only recovery option is a **power cycle erase** ("unbrick chip").  
It is therefore wise to add a small delay at the start of `main()` to allow erasing via programmer,  
or only remap this pin after pressing a button.

## Assembly

Assembly is relatively simple, but some parts (battery holder, on/off switch, buzzer) may be harder to source.  
**Tip:** Solder the OLED display **last** – otherwise it becomes tricky to mount the on/off switch properly.

With PCB ordered from JLCPCB, the total cost is around **100–200 CZK** (≈ 4–8 EUR).

## Notes & Recommendations

- Games from **CH32LibSDK** run smoothly despite the missing **KEY_B button**.
- For portable use, a **rechargeable LIR2032** is recommended instead of a standard CR2032, as some games and the OLED
  can quickly drain a regular battery.
- The design is compact and inexpensive, making it a great **DIY retro handheld project**.
